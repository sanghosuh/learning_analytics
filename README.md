# Public datasets for learning analytics & educational data mining

The two datasets are from [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php). I pre-processed them so they work with [Weka](https://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/). 

If you would like to see how they can be analyzed, you can see my report [here](https://sanghosuh.github.io/research/LA_EdMining_SanghoSuh.pdf).
